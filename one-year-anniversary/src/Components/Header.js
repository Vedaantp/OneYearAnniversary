                You are the best thing that has ever happened to me Jodie. I know we havn't been the best we can and it is
                my fault. But I want you to know that I love you and I am going to make you the happiest girl ever. From our
                first year together, I have learned so much about life. You taught me what it means to love, and I can never
                repay you for that. Every second I spend with you is the most magical and well spent time. I love being in your
                company. Just seeing you every day makes me the happiest man on the planet. I love the way you smile, its so pretty.
                I love the way your nose looks, its so cute. I love the way your hair flows, its so magical. I love the way your eyes
                look at me, it is the most heart stopping breath gasping jaw dropping feeling imaginable. I can't wait to see what comes
                next in our adventures and CAN NOT WAIT to spend the rest of eternal life with you. Here are some of my favorite memories
                with you from our first year together. I love you so much, MWAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
